# **Lightweight Agent Standard Working Group (LAS-WG) Charter**

## **1\. Motivation**

As agent-based systems gain widespread adoption, clear and open standards for agent-to-agent communication become increasingly important. Currently, many organizations are independently developing their own proprietary standards, leading to potential fragmentation. The LAS-WG seeks to proactively create lean, targeted standards that address specific problems, facilitating interoperability and innovation. The goal is to collaboratively establish universal standards with broad industry and institutional involvement, laying the groundwork for future adoption by larger standards bodies.

## **2\. Scope**

The LAS-WG focuses exclusively on the standardization of specific, clearly defined problems within agent-to-agent communication, agent operation, and agent-to-world communication. For the purposes of this WG, an agent is defined as any machine system capable of understanding and producing natural language and interacting with the world. The group explicitly avoids creating broad-scope standards and instead targets discrete, practical communication issues with simple, iterative solutions.

## **3\. Ethos**

The LAS-WG operates under these principles:

1. **Open Source**: Standards must remain openly accessible, transparent, and freely implementable.  
2. **Keep it Simple**: Solutions must be straightforward, intuitive, and easy to adopt.  
3. **Build Small**: Tackle 1-2 clearly defined problems at a time and iterate rapidly before moving on to the next issue.  
4. **Respect Existing Standards**: Do not duplicate or compete against already widely adopted protocols; instead, complement their strengths.  
5. **Industry Participation**: Actively engage with major companies in the agent ecosystem. A standard with high industry adoption is a successful standard.  
6. **Agility Over Perfection**: Quickly produce viable standards; prioritize experimentation and iteration over exhaustive deliberation. Practical testing and rapid deployment trump theoretical discussions.  
7. **Consensus**: Strive for consensus but accept majority agreement as sufficient for progress. Full unanimity is ideal but not necessary.  
8. **Community-oriented**: Seek active participation from the broader community. All discussions are public and freely accessible.

## **4\. Success Criteria**

The LAS-WG will be considered successful if it:

* Creates clearly defined, practically implementable standards addressing specific, important communication issues between agents.  
* Achieves adoption by key industry players, academic institutions, and relevant stakeholders.  
* Influences and contributes to the standardization efforts of larger recognized standards bodies.  
* Sustains consistent engagement from major stakeholders, maintaining productive, collaborative relationships.

## **5\. Coordination**

The LAS-WG closely coordinates with relevant external organizations detailed in [this external document](http://todo).

## **6\. Participation**

Membership is organization-based. Each member organization designates one representative responsible for voting and active participation, with substitutes permitted as necessary. Member organizations are listed [here](http://todo).

Organizations may participate officially (with formal endorsement from the parent organization) or with individual commitment (individuals affiliated with the organization participate without formal endorsement). Both types of participation are welcome and there is no practical distinction between the two (including for voting). Representative designation for organizations that join with individual commitment is handled on a case-by-case basis. Organizations may switch from individual commitment to official participation and vice versa.

Additional member organizations can be proposed by existing members; any proposal must be seconded by at least one other member organization. Approval of a new member organization requires a two-thirds relative majority vote within a standard one-week voting period unless specified otherwise by the Chair.

An organization may propose the removal of an organization from the working group membership. The request must be thoroughly justified and seconded by at least one other member organization. Removal requires a two-thirds relative majority vote within a three-week voting period unless a longer period is specified by the Chair.

The LAS-WG encourages active feedback and participation from the broader agent community, beyond formal member organizations. In particular, community members can take part in calls, open Github issues for the standards, and participate in the Discord server.

## **7\. Communication**

The LAS-WG holds weekly virtual meetings, which are recorded and transcribed for accessibility and convenience \- transcripts will be made publicly available on \[github repo link\]. However, the primary mode of communication occurs asynchronously through a dedicated Discord server. There is also a mailing list with updates.

All calls, transcripts, and outputs are public.

All proposals, modifications, and reviews related to standards occur via pull requests on GitHub, which enables open, asynchronous discussion and review. Editors maintain the text of a current draft that the Group has agreed to and suggest concrete wording when none is forthcoming from the group. Outreach roles are designated to engage the broader community actively and ensure external awareness and involvement. Other roles may be designated on a case-by-case basis.

## **8\. Decision Policy**

The LAS-WG aims to achieve decisions through rough consensus whenever feasible. If significant disagreement arises and reasonable objections cannot be resolved through discussion, the Chair or their substitute may call a formal vote. The Chair is aided by one or more co-Chairs.

Votes are decided by simple relative majority, typically lasting one week unless a longer period is specified by the Chair. All voting processes are public, with each member organization holding exactly one vote cast by their designated representative. In the event of a tie, the Chair or their substitute has the responsibility to break it. If the Chair is absent, one of the co-Chairs will preside; if no chairs are present, the Chair nominates a substitute.

## **9\. Licensing**

All LAS-WG outputs and standards shall be licensed under [Creative Commons BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) or an equivalently permissive license.

## **10\. Charter Modifications**

Modifications to this charter may be proposed by any member organization; any proposal must be seconded by at least one other member organization. Proposed modifications are discussed openly and require a two-thirds relative majority vote to be approved. The voting period for charter modifications is typically two weeks unless otherwise specified by the Chair. All charter modifications must be documented transparently.
