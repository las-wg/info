# Voting Members

As specified in the [Charter](./charter.md), members join individually, but vote following the "1 organization = 1 vote" rule.
It is worth noting that voting is a last-resort mechanism and in general we strive for rough consensus.

Being a voting member is not an indication of endorsement or affiliation between the organization and the LAS-WG.

The following organizations have voting rights:
- AgentOps
- Agora Protocol
- Agent Network Protocol
- Camel AI
- Centre for the Governance of AI
- Cosmos Institute
- LangChain
- Massachusetts Institute of Technology
- Stanford University
- University of Oxford
- Wildcard
